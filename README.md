## Introduction
Relive the old-school Facebook experience – clean, simple, and nostalgic.

rPack-F is a lightweight userscript that brings back a retro-style Facebook UI. Perfect for those who find the modern interface too cluttered and bloated.

## 🚀 Quick Installation
1. Install one of these userscript managers (only one is needed):

👉 Violentmonkey
👉 Tampermonkey

2. Click this link to install the script:
👉 Install rPack-F script [here](https://github.com/kennex666/rPack-F-Add-on/blob/main/fbretro.user.js)

3. Done! Open Facebook and enjoy the classic, retro-style interface.

## ⚠️ Important Notes
Facebook frequently tests different UI layouts per account, so the script might not work consistently for everyone.

The script works best with EN-US Facebook interface.

This userscript does not touch or track your data, it only changes how some UI elements are displayed.

If Facebook changes their layout significantly, the script may stop working or require an update.

The author is not responsible for any unexpected issues caused by Facebook changes or user modifications to the script.
