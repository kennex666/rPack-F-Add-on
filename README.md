## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes
Facebook frequently tests different UI layouts per account, so the script might not work consistently for everyone.

This userscript does not touch or track your data, it only changes how some UI elements are displayed.

If Facebook changes their layout significantly, the script may stop working or require an update.
